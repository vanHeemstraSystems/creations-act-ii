BUILD:\n\n\n\nMedium Priority (Build)\n• Accelerate product-style delivery over traditional methods: To deliver application functionality gradually and continuously, an application must be designed to consist of significantly independent components, each representing a concise and complete business capability. Development and DevOps tools must recognize this architecture and support encapsulation and adaptive assembly. Reject external applications that remain monolithic.\n• Modernize the application portfolio to enable PBC architecture: Give preference to application and platform vendors that recognize the architectural principles and structural consequences of the assembly-based model of delivering application experiences. In your design, use APIs and event streams everywhere and gradually repackage older applications in a way that isolates their discrete business capabilities. Look for opportunities to retire or consolidate applications to evolve to a more rationally funded and manageable architecture.\n• Develop joint business-IT accountability for business outcomes: Partitioning of an application into its business capabilities is best accomplished when technical and business values are considered together. The success of the future of applications therefore depends on organizations’ ability to bring business and IT together for collaborative and continuous creative work.\n• Use design thinking and customer journey maps to discover role-centric application experiences: To serve application users well, whether they be employees, partners or customers, start by understanding the priorities and objectives of individual roles inside the organization and allow personal preferences and best practices to be accommodated during application assembly. Begin with the end in mind: The customer’s application experience should drive the technical design, not the other way around."
